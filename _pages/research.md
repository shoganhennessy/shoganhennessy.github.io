My research focuses on estimating causal effects with unique data, for applications in labour economics.
I am in the third year of a PhD in economics at Cornell University, where I am contributing to multiple projects to build my dissertation.

## Working Papers

### [“Changes in Faculty Composition and Stagnating State Support for Higher Education,” in-preparation](https://github.com/shoganhennessy/state-funding-faculty)

Empirical economics project that causally links two recent trends:

- public universities' substitution towards contingent lecturers and teaching faculty, away from tenured professors
- stagnating support from state governments to state universities

The analysis uses a shift-share approach to show that falls in state support explain 40\% of the substitution towards lecturers, away from tenured faculty.
Analysis of every public university professor in Illinois implies that incumbent professors are unaffected, and that changes in faculty composition at public universities arise via falls in future hiring after funding cuts.

## Work in Progress

### “Estimates of US Food Insecurity Dynamics: Measuring Food Insecurity Across the US with a New Synthetic Panel Approach."  Joint with Seungmin Lee, Chris Barrett (Cornell)

Economics project measuring food insecurity, furthering applied econometrics methods to infer time dynamics in the absence of explicit panel data.

### [“Market Interventions in a Large-Scale Virtual Economy,” in-preparation](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2210.07970). Joint with Peter Xenopoulos, Claudio Silva (NYU)

Project studying the causal effects of market interventions in an online multiplayer game's economy.
Combines insights from applied econometrics, and data science in the study of virtual games.
