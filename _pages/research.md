My name is Senan, and I am a labour economist.
I am in the 5th year of an Economics PhD at Cornell University, where I am building my dissertation.

## Work in Progress

### The Direct and Indirect Effects of Genetics and Education (2024--).

Social science genetics has shown genes matter for education and labour market outcomes, but has little to say on the economic mechanisms beneath these findings.
I use plausibly random deviation from parents as a natural experiment for the Education PolyGenic Index (Ed PGI) to estimate causal effects of genes associated with years of education, using data from the UK Biobank.
I then decompose these genetic effects into a direct genetic effect and indirect education pathway using a causal mediation framework that allows for selection-into-education, using multiple UK university openings in the 1960s as instruments for higher education attendance. 
The Ed PGI increases labour market earnings through higher education attendance, with direct genetic effects indistinguishable from zero --- contradicting previous speculation that education-linked genes independently increase intelligence or other labour market traits.
Education linked genes are more about returns to higher education, and less about direct genetic effects.
These findings reframe social science genetics by shifting focus from asking ''if genes matter'' to ''how genes matter'' --- not as deterministic forces, but as factors that influence human capital investment decisions within institutional constraints.
By using causal methods that explicitly account for individual choice, rather than assuming genetic determinism, this research provides a richer understanding of how biological inheritance, personal agency, and institutional structures interact to shape labour market inequality.

### Causal Mediation in Natural Experiments [(2025)](https://github.com/shoganhennessy/mediation-natural-experiment/blob/main/mediation-natural-experiment-2025.pdf).

Natural experiments are a cornerstone of applied economics, providing settings for estimating causal effects with a compelling argument for treatment ignorability.
Causal Mediation (CM) methods aim to estimate how much of the treatment effect operates through a proposed mediator, illuminating mechanisms that causal effects operate through.
The most popular approach to CM relies on assumptions which are unrealistic in natural experiment settings: assuming the mediator is conditionally ignorable --- in addition to the causal research design for the initial treatment.
This paper shows that this approach leads to biased inference, solving for explicit bias terms when the mediator is not ignorable.
Individuals' selection based on expected gains and costs is inconsistent with mediator ignorability in a natural experiment setting, suggesting bias would be present in practice.
I consider a control function approach, which overcomes these hurdles under alternative assumptions, using cost of mediator take-up as an instrument.
Simulations confirm that this method corrects for persistent bias in conventional CM estimates, though require large sample sizes for correct inference.
This approach gives applied researchers an alternative method to estimate CM effects when they can only establish a credible argument for randomisation of the initial treatment, and not a mediator, as is common in natural experiments.

### Food Insecurity Among Military Veterans (2023--), joint with Seungmin Lee (Notre Dame), Chris Barrett, John Hoddinott (Cornell), Matthew Rabbitt (USDA)

Economics project measuring food insecurity among military veterans, using newly crafted data from the PSID to causally measure the impact of military enlistment on food insecurity outcomes.


## Working Papers

### Less Funding, More Lecturers, and Fewer Professors: Stagnating State Funding for Higher Education and its Effect on Faculty [(2024)](https://github.com/shoganhennessy/state-funding-faculty/blob/main/.state-funding-faculty-2024.pdf).

Empirical economics project that causally links two recent trends:

- Public universities' substitution towards contingent lecturers and teaching faculty, away from tenure-track/tenured professors
- Stagnating state funding for US public universities.

The analysis uses a shift-share approach to show that declining state funding explains the substitution towards lecturers away from professors.
Analysis of every public university faculty member in Illinois shows that incumbent professors are unaffected, implying changes in faculty composition at public universities arise via falls in future hiring after funding cuts.

### Market Interventions in a Large-Scale Virtual Economy [(2022, with Peter Xenopoulos, Claudio Silva at NYU)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2210.07970).

Study of large market interventions in an online multiplayer game's economy, and the causal effects on market activity.
Combines insights from applied economics and data science in the study of virtual games.
