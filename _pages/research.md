My name is Senan, and I am a labour economist.
I am in the 5th year of an Economics PhD at Cornell University, where I am building my dissertation.

## Working Papers

### [Less Funding, More Lecturers, and Fewer Professors: Stagnating State Funding for Higher Education and its Effect on Faculty (2024)](https://github.com/shoganhennessy/state-funding-faculty/blob/main/state-funding-faculty-2024.pdf)

Empirical economics project that causally links two recent trends:

- Public universities' substitution towards contingent lecturers and teaching faculty, away from tenure-track/tenured professors
- Stagnating state funding for US public universities.

The analysis uses a shift-share approach to show that declining state funding explains the substitution towards lecturers away from professors.
Analysis of every public university faculty member in Illinois shows that incumbent professors are unaffected, implying changes in faculty composition at public universities arise via falls in future hiring after funding cuts.

## Work in Progress

### The Direct and Indirect Effects of Genetics and Education (2024--)

Recent advances in genetic technology measure genetic locations in the human genome associated with health and social outcomes, such as years of education.
These measures are polygenic indices, and a nascent literature economic literature documents how the education polygenic index (Ed PGI, Lee et al 2018) is related to many outcomes, including retirement wealth, life-cycle income, elementary school performance, and longevity.
This work re-analyses the claims that Ed PGI affects later-life labour market outcomes directly, and whether its effects can be explained purely by returns to education --- without direct genetic effects.
I use genetic and labour market data for thousands of members of the British public, in the UK Biobank, and mediation methods to decompose the direct and indirect effects of genetic predisposition to education (EA Gene Score) on later-life earnings.
I show that conventional mediation methods may be contaminated when breaking assumptions, and derive the corresponding selection bias terms.
I show that the selection-on-observables assumptions are unrealistic in most natural experiment settings, concluding that natural experiments are particularly vulnerable to biased direct and indirect effect estimates.
Correspondingly, I use an overlapping natural experiment design to isolate causal effects using random variation in both genetics and education, to avoid breaking the above assumptions.
Genetic deviation from one's parent gives plausibly random variation in genetic measures, and a legal change in school-leaving age instruments for random variation in education years.
This approach gives a local version of the direct and indirect effects, local to the school-leaving age instrument compliers.
Correlational evidence with public data shows that direct genetic effects are indistinguishable from zero --- all causal effects of the Ed PGI are explained by more years of education, and not by a direct channel.
Causal estimates using restricted UK Biobank data are to follow.

### Food Insecurity Among Military Veterans (2023--), joint with Seungmin Lee (Notre Dame), Chris Barrett, John Hoddinott (Cornell), Matthew Rabbitt (USDA)

Economics project measuring food insecurity among military veterans, using newly crafted data from the PSID to causally measure the impact of military enlistment on food insecurity outcomes.

### Estimates of US Food Insecurity Dynamics: Measuring Food Insecurity Across the US with a New Synthetic Panel Approach (2023--), joint with Seungmin Lee, Chris Barrett, John Hoddinott (Cornell)

Economics project measuring food insecurity, with new applied econometrics methods to infer time dynamics in the absence of explicit panel data, measuring food insecurity in the US Census (CPS-FSS).


### [Market Interventions in a Large-Scale Virtual Economy (2022),](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2210.07970) joint with Peter Xenopoulos, Claudio Silva (NYU)

Study of large market interventions in an online multiplayer game's economy, and the causal effects on market activity.
Combines insights from applied econometrics and data science in the study of virtual games.
