My research focuses on estimating causal effects with unique data, in the field of labour economics.
I am in the fourth year of an Economics PhD at Cornell University, where I am contributing to multiple projects to build my dissertation.

## Working Papers

### [“Changes in Faculty Composition and Stagnating State Support for Higher Education,” 2023](https://github.com/shoganhennessy/state-funding-faculty/blob/main/state-funding-faculty-2023.pdf)

Empirical economics project that causally links two recent trends:

- public universities' substitution towards contingent lecturers and teaching faculty, away from tenured professors
- stagnating support from state governments to state universities

The analysis uses a shift-share approach to show that falls in state support explaining the substitution towards lecturers, away from tenured faculty.
Analysis of every public university professor in Illinois implies that incumbent professors are unaffected, and that changes in faculty composition at public universities arise via falls in future hiring after funding cuts.

## Work in Progress

### “Mendelian Randomisation for the Returns to Education.”

Economics work-in-progress advancing instrumental variables methods in empirical labour.
I connect the exclusion restriction assumption with the causal mediation literature, and an application to using genetic measures as instruments (a.k.a. Mendelian randomisation).

### “Estimates of US Food Insecurity Dynamics: Measuring Food Insecurity Across the US with a New Synthetic Panel Approach."  Joint with Seungmin Lee, Chris Barrett (Cornell)

Economics project measuring food insecurity, furthering applied econometrics methods to infer time dynamics in the absence of explicit panel data, and measuring food insecuirty in the US Census (CPS-FSS).

### [“Market Interventions in a Large-Scale Virtual Economy,” 2022](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2210.07970). Joint with Peter Xenopoulos, Claudio Silva (NYU)

Study of large market interventions in an online multiplayer game's economy, and the causal effects on market activity.
Combines insights from applied econometrics, and data science in the study of virtual games.
