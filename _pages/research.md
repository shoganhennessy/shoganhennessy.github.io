My work analyses economics systems, usually related to individuals' education and career choices, using real-world data.
I am in the third year of a PhD in economics at Cornell University, and am contributing to multiple projects to build my dissertation.

## Working Papers

### Changes in Faculty Composition and Stagnating State Support for Higher Education

In-preparation, view-able [here](https://github.com/shoganhennessy/state-faculty-composition).

State support for higher education has stagnated on a per-student level, while public universities have reduced their employment of tenure-track or tenured professors, and increased their employment of contingent lecturers (per student).
This analysis relates these changes in the faculty composition at public universities to the fall in per-student university revenues from state appropriations.
A shift-share instrumental variables approach addresses endogeneity in decisions for state appropriations to higher education, by exploiting the yearly change in state support with an institutionâ€™s reliance on that support.
A decrease in state funding of 10%, via a shock to state appropriations, decreases the number of assistant professors per student at a public university by 1.4% and full professors by 1.2%, yet increases the number of lecturers per student by 4.4%.
Analysis of all the professors hired at Illinois public universities 2011-2021 shows that incumbent professors are not affected by the changes in state support, implying that these changes in faculty composition arose by reduced hiring of tenure-track and tenured professors at public universities.
Forthcoming work investigates the extend of effect on faculty hiring at universities, and thus whether the hiring channel explains the change in faculty composition.
These results exhibit one long-term effect of stagnating state support for higher education, and raises questions about the direction that public education heads as these financial headwinds show no sign of dissipating.

### Market Interventions in a Large-Scale Virtual Economy

In-preparation, view-able [here](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2210.07970).
Joint work with Peter Xenopoulos, Claudio Silva (NYU)

Massively multiplayer online role-playing games often contain sophisticated in-game economies.
Many important real-world economic phenomena, such as inflation, economic growth, and business cycles, are also present in these virtual economies.
One major difference between real-world and virtual economies is the ease and frequency by which a policymaker, in this case, a game developer, can introduce economic shocks.
These economic shocks, typically implemented with game updates or signalled through community channels, provide fertile ground to study the effects of economic interventions on markets.
In this work, we study the effect of in-game economic market interventions, namely, a transaction tax and an item sink, in Old School RuneScape.
Using causal inference methods, we find that the tax did not meaningfully affect the trading volume of items at the tax boundaries and that the item sink contributed to the inflation of luxury good prices, without reducing trade volume.
Furthermore, we find evidence that the illicit gold trading market was relatively unaffected by the implemented market interventions.
Our findings yield useful insights not only into the effect of market interventions in virtual economies but also for real-world markets.

## Work in Progress

### Estimates of US Food Insecurity Dynamics: Measuring Food Insecurity Across the US with a New Synthetic Panel Approach

Joint work with Seungmin Lee, Chris Barrett (Cornell, Dyson)

Economics project measuring food insecurity, furthering applied econometrics methods to infer time dynamics in the absence of explicit panel data.

### Immediate Effects of a Faculty Union

Labour economics project analysing the (causal) effect of a new collective bargaining agreement on public university professors.
Focuses on the differential effects on tenured and non-tenured professors, using a difference-in-difference approach.

### Overlapping Measures of Rideshare Drivers' Hours and Earnings in the Gig Economy

Joint work with Louis Hyman, Yudi Wang (Cornell, Industrial Labor Relations)

General interest project combining multiple sources of administrative data on the exact hours worked of rideshare drivers.
In-prepartion draft delayed by recent developments at Uber.
