My name is Senan, and I am a labour economist.
I am in the 5th year of an Economics PhD at Cornell University, where I am building my dissertation.

## Working Papers

### [Less Funding, More Lecturers, and Fewer Professors: Stagnating State Funding for Higher Education and its Effect on Faculty (2024)](https://github.com/shoganhennessy/state-funding-faculty/blob/main/state-funding-faculty-2024.pdf)

Empirical economics project that causally links two recent trends:

- Public universities' substitution towards contingent lecturers and teaching faculty, away from tenure-track/tenured professors
- Stagnating state funding for US public universities.

The analysis uses a shift-share approach to show that declining state funding explains the substitution towards lecturers away from professors.
Analysis of every public university faculty member in Illinois shows that incumbent professors are unaffected, implying changes in faculty composition at public universities arise via falls in future hiring after funding cuts.

## Work in Progress

### The Direct and Indirect Effects of Genetics and Education (2024--)

Recent advances in genetic technology measure genetic locations in the human genome associated with health and social outcomes, such as years of education --- polygenic indices.
I show how that the Education year PolyGenic Index (Ed PGI, [Lee et al 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0147-3)) is related to later-life earnings, using random variation away from parents' genes to infer causal effects.
Recent social science literature has speculated that genes associated with education relate to intelligence, and so would have independent, direct genetic effects on labour market outcomes.
Then, I decompose the effects into direct genetic, and indirect effects from returns to education, using genetic and labour market data for thousands of members of the British public in the UK Biobank, and mediation methods to decompose the effects.
I derive selection bias terms for conventional mediation methods when education is not randomly assigned --- as is likely the case for any mediator in any natural experiment settings.
To avoid this, I use a legal change in school-leaving age to instrument for random variation in education, and estimate direct and indirect effects local to these compliers.
Correlational evidence with public data shows that direct genetic associations are indistinguishable from zero --- all causal associations of the Ed PGI are explained by the indirect education channel, and not by a direct genetic channel.
Causal estimates using restricted UK Biobank data are to follow.

### Food Insecurity Among Military Veterans (2023--), joint with Seungmin Lee (Notre Dame), Chris Barrett, John Hoddinott (Cornell), Matthew Rabbitt (USDA)

Economics project measuring food insecurity among military veterans, using newly crafted data from the PSID to causally measure the impact of military enlistment on food insecurity outcomes.

### Estimates of US Food Insecurity Dynamics: Measuring Food Insecurity Across the US with a New Synthetic Panel Approach (2023--), joint with Seungmin Lee, Chris Barrett, John Hoddinott (Cornell)

Economics project measuring food insecurity, with new applied econometrics methods to infer time dynamics in the absence of explicit panel data, measuring food insecurity in the US Census (CPS-FSS).


### [Market Interventions in a Large-Scale Virtual Economy (2022),](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2210.07970) joint with Peter Xenopoulos, Claudio Silva (NYU)

Study of large market interventions in an online multiplayer game's economy, and the causal effects on market activity.
Combines insights from applied econometrics and data science in the study of virtual games.
