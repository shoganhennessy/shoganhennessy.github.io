My research is generally in the field of labour economics, with a number of different applications.
I am in the fourth year of an Economics PhD at Cornell University, where I am contributing to multiple projects to build my dissertation.

## Working Papers

### [Less Funding, More Lecturers, and Fewer Professors: Stagnating State Funding for Higher Education and its Effect on Faculty (2024)](https://github.com/shoganhennessy/state-funding-faculty/blob/main/state-funding-faculty-2024.pdf)

Empirical economics project that causally links two recent trends:

- public universities' substitution towards contingent lecturers and teaching faculty, away from tenure-track/tenured professors
- stagnating state funding for US public universities

The analysis uses a shift-share approach to show that declining state funding explains the substitution towards lecturers away from professors.
Analysis of every public university faculty member in Illinois shows that incumbent professors are unaffected, implying changes in faculty composition at public universities arise via falls in future hiring after funding cuts.

## Work in Progress

### The Mendelian Randomisation Research Design (2023--)

Economics work-in-progress working to achieve (1) inference for instrumental variables (IV) models when the exclusion restriction is broken, and (2) a demonstration of Mendelian randomisation for the returns to education despite significant violations of the exclusion restriction.

Non-parametric identification in IV models is contaminated by violations in the exclusion restriction, but insights from the causal mediation literature can recover inference on treatment effects under alternative assumptions.
These insights inform an application of IV with genetic data, Mendelian randomisation, which is extremely influential in biological sciences --- but not in economics thanks to invalidity of the exclusion restriction in economic applications.
I return to the classic labour economics problem of estimating labour market returns to education, using genetic and labour market data on retirement-age Americans from the Health and Retirement Study.
Mendelian randomisation produces estimates similar to previous results in the labour economics literature, after using methods to account for violations in the exclusion restriction.
These results inform future analyses using IV methods when the exclusion restriction is in doubt, and advocate for further work using Mendelian randomisation in economics research.

### Estimates of US Food Insecurity Dynamics: Measuring Food Insecurity Across the US with a New Synthetic Panel Approach (2023--), joint with Seungmin Lee, Chris Barrett, John Hoddinott (Cornell)

Economics project measuring food insecurity, furthering applied econometrics methods to infer time dynamics in the absence of explicit panel data, and measuring food insecurity in the US Census (CPS-FSS).

### [Market Interventions in a Large-Scale Virtual Economy (2022),](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2210.07970) joint with Peter Xenopoulos, Claudio Silva (NYU)

Study of large market interventions in an online multiplayer game's economy, and the causal effects on market activity.
Combines insights from applied econometrics, and data science in the study of virtual games.
