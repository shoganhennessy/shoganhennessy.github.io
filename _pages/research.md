### The Direct and Indirect Effects of Genetics and Education (2025, JMP).

I investigate whether genes associated with education affect labour market outcomes directly or primarily through educational choices, using random genetic inheritance as a natural experiment and developing causal methods that account for human capital decisions rather than assuming genetic determinism.

Draft forthcoming.

    <summary> Extended Abstract </summary>
    Recent genetic research has shown that genes matter for education and labour market outcomes, but has little to say on the economic mechanisms beneath these findings.
    I use plausibly random deviation from parents as a natural experiment for the Education PolyGenic Index (Ed PGI) to estimate causal effects of genes associated with years of education, using data from the UK Biobank.
    I then decompose these genetic effects into a direct genetic effect and indirect education pathway using a causal mediation framework that allows for selection-into-education, using multiple UK university openings in the 1960s as instruments for higher education attendance. 
    The Ed PGI increases labour market earnings through higher education attendance, with direct genetic effects indistinguishable from zero --- contradicting previous speculation that education-linked genes independently increase intelligence or other labour market traits.
    Education linked genes are more about returns to higher education, and less about direct genetic effects.
    These findings reframe social science genetics by shifting focus from asking ''if genes matter'' to ''how genes matter'' --- not as deterministic forces, but as factors that influence human capital decisions within institutional constraints.
    By using causal methods that explicitly account for individual choice, rather than assuming genetic determinism, this research provides a richer understanding of how biological inheritance, personal agency, and institutional structures interact to shape labour market inequality.

### Causal Mediation in Natural Experiments (2025).

Applied econometrics paper showing how mediation works (or does not work) in a quasi-experimental setting --- and what to do about it.

    <summary> Extended Abstract </summary>
    Natural experiments are a cornerstone of applied economics, providing settings for estimating causal effects with a compelling argument for treatment randomisation.
    Applied researchers often investigate mechanisms behind treatment effects by controlling for a mediator of interest, alluding to Causal Mediation (CM) methods for estimating direct and indirect effects (CM effects).
    This approach to investigating mechanisms unintentionally assumes the mediator is quasi-randomly assigned --- in addition to quasi-random assignment of the initial treatment.
    Individuals' choice to take (or refuse) a mediator based on costs and benefits is inconsistent with this assumption, suggesting in-practice estimates of CM effects are contaminated by bias terms which crowd out inference.
    I consider an alternative approach to credibly estimate CM effects, using control function methods and relying on instrumental variation in mediator take-up cost.
    Simulations confirm this approach corrects for bias in conventional CM estimates, providing parametric and semi-parametric methods.
    This approach gives applied researchers an alternative method to estimate CM effects when 
    an initial treatment is quasi-randomly assigned, but the mediator is not, as is common in natural experiments.
