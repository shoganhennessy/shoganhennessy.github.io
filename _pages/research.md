My name is Senan, and I am a labour economist.
I am in the 5th year of an Economics PhD at Cornell University, where I am finishing my dissertation.

## The Direct and Indirect Effects of Genetics and Education (2025, JMP).

I investigate whether genes associated with education affect labor market outcomes directly or primarily through educational choices, using random genetic inheritance as a natural experiment and developing causal methods that account for individual choice rather than assuming genetic determinism.

Draft forthcoming.

    <summary> Extended Abstract </summary>
    Social science genetics has shown genes matter for education and labour market outcomes, but has little to say on the economic mechanisms beneath these findings.
    I use plausibly random deviation from parents as a natural experiment for the Education PolyGenic Index (Ed PGI) to estimate causal effects of genes associated with years of education, using data from the UK Biobank.
    I then decompose these genetic effects into a direct genetic effect and indirect education pathway using a causal mediation framework that allows for selection-into-education, using multiple UK university openings in the 1960s as instruments for higher education attendance. 
    The Ed PGI increases labour market earnings through higher education attendance, with direct genetic effects indistinguishable from zero --- contradicting previous speculation that education-linked genes independently increase intelligence or other labour market traits.
    Education linked genes are more about returns to higher education, and less about direct genetic effects.
    These findings reframe social science genetics by shifting focus from asking ''if genes matter'' to ''how genes matter'' --- not as deterministic forces, but as factors that influence human capital investment decisions within institutional constraints.
    By using causal methods that explicitly account for individual choice, rather than assuming genetic determinism, this research provides a richer understanding of how biological inheritance, personal agency, and institutional structures interact to shape labour market inequality.

## Causal Mediation in Natural Experiments (2025).

Applied econometrics paper showing how mediation works (or does not work) in a quasi-experimental/observational setting --- and what to do about it.

    <summary> Extended Abstract </summary>
    Natural experiments are a cornerstone of applied economics, providing settings for estimating causal effects with a compelling argument for treatment ignorability.
    Applied researchers often investigate mechanisms behind treatment effects by controlling for a mediator of interest, alluding to Causal Mediation (CM) methods for estimating direct and indirect effects (CM effects).
    This approach to investigating mechanisms unintentionally assumes the mediator is quasi-randomly assigned --- in addition to the quasi-random assignment of the initial treatment.
    Individuals' choice to take (or refuse) a mediator based on costs and benefits is inconsistent with mediator ignorability, suggesting in-practice estimates of CM effects are biased in natural experiment settings.
    I solve for explicit bias terms when the mediator is not ignorable, imitating classical selection bias for average causal effects.
    I consider an alternative approach to credibly estimate CM effects, when selection-into-mediator is driven by unobserved costs and benefits.
    The approach uses a control function adjustment, relying on mediator take-up cost as an instrument.
    Simulations confirm that this method corrects for selection bias in conventional CM estimates, providing both parametric and semi-parametric methods.
    This approach gives applied researchers an alternative method to estimate CM effects when they can only establish a credible argument for quasi-random assignment of the initial treatment, and not a mediator, as is common in natural experiments.
