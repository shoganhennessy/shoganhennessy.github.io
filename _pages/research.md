My name is Senan, and I am a labour economist.
I am in the 5th year of an Economics PhD at Cornell University, where I am building my dissertation.

## Working Papers

### [Less Funding, More Lecturers, and Fewer Professors: Stagnating State Funding for Higher Education and its Effect on Faculty (2024)](https://github.com/shoganhennessy/state-funding-faculty/blob/main/state-funding-faculty-2024.pdf)

Empirical economics project that causally links two recent trends:

- Public universities' substitution towards contingent lecturers and teaching faculty, away from tenure-track/tenured professors
- Stagnating state funding for US public universities.

The analysis uses a shift-share approach to show that declining state funding explains the substitution towards lecturers away from professors.
Analysis of every public university faculty member in Illinois shows that incumbent professors are unaffected, implying changes in faculty composition at public universities arise via falls in future hiring after funding cuts.

## Work in Progress

### The Direct and Indirect Effects of Genetics and Education (2024--)

Recent advances in genetic technology measure genetic locations in the human genome associated with health and social outcomes, such as years of education.
These measures are genetic scores, and a nascent literature economic literature documents how the education genetic score (EA Gene Score, Lee et al 2018) is related to many outcomes, including retirement wealth, life-cycle income, elementary school performance, and longevity.
This work re-analyses the claims that education genetic score affects outcomes directly, and whether its effects can be explained purely by returns to education without any direct genetic effects.
I use genetic and labour market data on retirement-age Americans from the Health and Retirement Study, and mediation methods to decompose the direct and indirect effects of genetic predisposition to education (EA Gene Score) on later-life earnings.
Conventional mediation methods rely on a selection-on-observables assumption for selection into education, which is unlikely to hold true in an observational setting.
I develop expressions for selection bias in mediation estimators, and survey the labour econometric methods for overcoming selection bias, including IV and structural selection models.
After adjusting mediation methods for selection into education, the direct genetic channel is indistinguishable from zero, while the channel for returns to education is positive and aligns with previous estimates for returns to education.
These results add structure to claims that genetics affects education and income, exposing that the EA Gene Score may not affect later-life income directly, as claimed by previous research.
This work sets the stage for further research disentangling the direct and indirect effects of new genetic measures.

### Estimates of US Food Insecurity Dynamics: Measuring Food Insecurity Across the US with a New Synthetic Panel Approach (2023--), joint with Seungmin Lee, Chris Barrett, John Hoddinott (Cornell)

Economics project measuring food insecurity, with new applied econometrics methods to infer time dynamics in the absence of explicit panel data, measuring food insecurity in the US Census (CPS-FSS).

### Food Insecurity Among Military Veterans: New Evidence from the PSID (2023--), joint with Seungmin Lee, Chris Barrett, John Hoddinott (Cornell), Matthew Rabbitt (USDA)

Economics project measuring food insecurity among military veterans, using newly crafted data from the PSID to causally measure the impact of military enlistment on food insecurity outcomes.
