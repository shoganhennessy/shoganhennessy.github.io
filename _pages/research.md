### The Labour Market Effects of Genetics and Education (2025, JMP).

I investigate the extent that genes associated with education affect labour market outcomes, using random genetic inheritance as a natural experiment and adjusting various statistical concerns.

Draft forthcoming.

### Causal Mediation in Natural Experiments (2025).

Applied econometrics paper showing how mediation works (or does not work) in a quasi-experimental setting --- and what to do about it.

    <summary> Extended Abstract </summary>
    Natural experiments are a cornerstone of applied economics, providing settings for estimating causal effects with a compelling argument for treatment randomisation, but give little indication of the mechanisms behind causal effects.
    Causal Mediation (CM) provides a framework to analyse mechanisms by identifying the average direct and indirect effects (CM effects), yet conventional CM methods require the relevant mediator is as-good-as-randomly assigned.
    When people choose the mediator based on costs and benefits (whether to visit a doctor, to attend university, etc.), this assumption fails and conventional CM analyses are at risk of bias.
    I propose a control function strategy that uses instrumental variation in mediator take-up costs, delivering unbiased direct and indirect effects when selection is driven by unobserved gains.
    The method identifies CM effects via the marginal effect of the mediator, with parametric or semi-parametric estimation that is simple to implement in two stages.
    Applying these methods to the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment reveals a substantial portion of the Medicaid lottery's effect on self-reported health and happiness flows through increased healthcare usage --- an effect that a conventional CM analysis would mistake.
    This approach gives applied researchers an alternative method to estimate CM effects when an initial treatment is quasi-randomly assigned, but the mediator is not, as is common in natural experiments.
