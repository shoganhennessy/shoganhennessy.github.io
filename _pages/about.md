I am a PhD student in the Department of Economics at Cornell University, and I study labour economics with a focus on causal inference and using tools from data science.

This is my personal website, powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com).
Here I host my work in progress and some general research thoughts.

Take a look at my [CV here](https://shoganhennessy.github.io/cv/), and my [Cornell profile here](https://economics.cornell.edu/senan-hogan-hennessy).
