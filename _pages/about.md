I am a PhD student in the Department of Economics at Cornell University, and my research focuses on estimating causal effects in empirical labour economics.
My primary focus uses tools from data science to build unique data, and econometric methodology to uncover the underlying systems and economic processes.

I am passionate about the study of inequality, data-centric research, and open-source software.
