  I am passionate about the study of inequality, data-centric research, and open-source software.
  Take a look at my early stage thoughts in my [posts tab](https://shoganhennessy.github.io/year-archive/).

  You can see my [CV here](https://shoganhennessy.github.io/files/cv/cv-shoganhennessy.pdf), and my [Cornell profile here](https://economics.cornell.edu/senan-hogan-hennessy).[^1]

  When not contributing to my research, I am usually [riding my bike](https://shoganhennessy.github.io/cycling/).
