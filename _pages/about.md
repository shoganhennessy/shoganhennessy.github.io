I am a PhD student in the Department of Economics at Cornell University, and my research focuses on estimating causal effects and applications in economics.
I use tools from data science to build unique data, and employ econometric models to uncover causal relationships in economic applications.
My [recent work](https://shoganhennessy.github.io/research/) focuses on:

- The changing composition of faculty at US public universities
- Methods to estimate persistence of food in security among families in the US, in the absence of precise panel data

I am passionate about the study of inequality, data-centric research, and open-source software.
Take a look at my thoughts in my [posts tab](https://shoganhennessy.github.io/year-archive/), details on my academic work in my [research tab](https://shoganhennessy.github.io/research/).
