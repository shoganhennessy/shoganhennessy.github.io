I am a PhD student in the Economics Department at Cornell University, and my research is in labour economics.
My economics [job market project](https://shoganhennessy.github.io/research/) focuses on:

- New methods to analyse mechanisms behind causal effects in observational studies, acknowledging selection in a causal mediation framework
- Estimating the effects of genes associated with education, adjusting for various statistical concerns and questioning claims of ``direct genetic effects.''

I am passionate about the study of inequality, data-centric research, and open-source software.
