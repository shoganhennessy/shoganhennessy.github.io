I am a PhD student in the Department of Economics at Cornell University, and I study labour economics using tools from data science.
I'm passionate about the study of inequality, data-centric research, and open-sourced software.

When not contributing to my research, I am usually [riding my bike](https://shoganhennessy.github.io/cycling/).

Take a look at my [CV here](https://shoganhennessy.github.io/files/cv/cv-shoganhennessy.pdf), and my [Cornell profile here](https://economics.cornell.edu/senan-hogan-hennessy).

My personal website is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com).
