I am a PhD student in the Economics Department at Cornell University, and my research uses learns about causal relationships in labour economics.

My [recent research](https://shoganhennessy.github.io/research/) focuses on:

- Mendelian Randomisation, and estimating causal effects in labour economics when the exclusion restriction is not credible
- Faculty in US higher education, documenting the substitution away from employing tenured professors towards contingent lecturers following falls in state funding
- Persistence of food in security among families in the US, in the absence of precise panel data.

I am passionate about the study of inequality, data-centric research, and open-source software.
