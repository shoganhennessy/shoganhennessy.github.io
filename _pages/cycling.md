Road cycling is my main hobby, outside academic pursuits.
I ride my bike up to a dozen hours a week, and participate primarily in road criteria as a category 4 racer.

My current amateur racing team is [B2C2 Cycling](https://b2c2cycling.com/).
We are committed to equality in the sport, and generally having a good time on two wheels.

Strava is the only social media platform I use; you can follow my cycling over here.
