Road cycling is my main hobby, outside of academic pursuits.

I started in my time at Pomona College, where I became the president of the college cycling club, and made some great friends from Cal State Fullerton and Team Go-Fast in the local race scene.

When I moved to Boston I joined my current amateur racing team, [B2C2 Cycling](?).
We're committed to equality in the sport, and generally having a good time on two wheels.

Strava is the only social media platform I use, so you can follow my cycling over here.
