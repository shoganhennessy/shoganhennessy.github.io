Road cycling is my main hobby, outside of academic pursuits.

When I lived Boston I joined my current amateur racing team, <a href="http://b2c2cycling.com/">B2C2 Cycling</a>.
We're committed to equality in the sport, and generally having a good time on two wheels.

I started cycling at Pomona College, where I became the president of the college cycling club, and made some great friends in the local race scene from Cal State Fullerton and Team Go-Fast.

Strava is the only social media platform I use, so you can follow my cycling over here.
