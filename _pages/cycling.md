Road cycling is my main hobby, outside of academic pursuits.
I ride my bike up to a dozen hours a week, and participate primarily in road criteria as a category 4 racer.

When I lived in Boston I joined my current amateur racing team, [B2C2 Cycling](https://b2c2cycling.com/).
We're committed to equality in the sport, and generally having a good time on two wheels.

Strava is the only social media platform I use; you can follow my cycling over here.
