        Causal Mediation in Natural Experiments (2025).}}

    Natural experiments are a cornerstone of applied economics, providing settings for estimating causal effects with a compelling argument for treatment randomisation, but give little indication of the mechanisms behind causal effects.
    Causal Mediation (CM) provides a framework to analyse mechanisms by identifying the average direct and indirect effects (CM effects), yet conventional CM methods require the relevant mediator is as-good-as-randomly assigned.
    When people choose the mediator based on costs and benefits (whether to visit a doctor, to attend university, etc.), this assumption fails and conventional CM analyses are at risk of bias.
    I propose a control function strategy that uses instrumental variation in mediator take-up costs, delivering unbiased direct and indirect effects when selection is driven by unobserved gains.
    The method identifies CM effects via the marginal effect of the mediator, with parametric or semi-parametric estimation that is simple to implement in two stages.
    Applying these methods to the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment reveals a substantial portion of the Medicaid lottery's effect on self-reported health and happiness flows through increased healthcare usage --- an effect that a conventional CM analysis would mistake.
    This approach gives applied researchers an alternative method to estimate CM effects when an initial treatment is quasi-randomly assigned, but the mediator is not, as is common in natural experiments. \\ \\

        Less Funding, More Lecturers, and Fewer Professors (2024).}}

    Public universities employ more lecturers and fewer professors today than at any other point in the last thirty years, relative to student enrolment.
    At the same time, state funding for higher education has stagnated.
    This paper shows that the decline in state funding led to a substitution away from professors toward lecturers at US public universities.
    Using a shift-share approach to instrument for state funding, I find that universities employ 4.4\% more lecturers per student following a 10\% funding cut.
    This shift is accompanied by a reduction in assistant and full professors by 1.4\% and 1.2\%  per student, respectively.
    These effects are concentrated to 1990--2009, with waning national trends for 2010 and onwards.
    Incumbent professors' salaries, promotion rates, and quit rates at Illinois universities remain unaffected by large funding cuts in the 2010s, indicating that the substitution arose from limiting the hiring of new professors.
    Stagnating state funding impacts public universities and faculty, likely contributing to deteriorating student outcomes at public universities since the 1990s. \\ \\
